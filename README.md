## Description:
 Automated Attendance System is the semester project of Object Orianted Software Engineering. This project will be carried out by Object Orianted principles and the backend operations will be carried out through Java language.
We are designing automatic attendance system using face detection. The system needs or required video recording device. It detects the face and mark attendance accordingly. This system will prevent unnecessary wastage of time that is usually wasted in form of class roll calls. In the Automated Attendance System, the process flow is initiated by being able to detect the facial features from a camera or a picture stored in a memory.
It is a  paperless attendance system which will automated the attendance systems of all educational institutes.
    All you have to do is scan the faces of students and the system will compare the faces of students against the saved ones in data base.

	
## Vision and Business Cases:

The system will automate the attendance system of all educational institutes.
It will be useful in preventing proxy attendance.
It will save time up to at least 5 minutes per class.
It is the most efficient way of marking attendance.
There is no margin of mistake as there is in manual system.


##  Motivation

Attendance is taken during lectures and how much time it takes. The use of ID cards or manually calling out attendance and writing it down on sheets is not productive and efficient. This system will detect the number of faces on the class and will also identify them from the store database
	


	
## Executive summary:
it is an attendance system fully based on artificial intelligence. The system will scan students and compare them with the saved data in data base. It will be very helpful in reduction of attendance time and also false attendance. All a teacher has to do is to scan student faces and the rest is done by the system. It will automate the attendance system with more efficiency and reliability.
